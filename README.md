# Wolf's Den C + Lua + BearLibTerminal Edition

This is a C-focused port of my Wolf's Den roguelike concept used for learning new languages. It embeds Lua as a scripting language.
This will be worked on as interest and time allow.

# How to Run

Windows releases will be provided from time to time. Instructions for compiling from source will be provided as I work out a decent
toolchain. Right now, I'm using gcc and ming32w-make from MinGW.

# DONE

* Hello, BearLibTerminal/C!
* Screen interface
* Moving @ demo
* slightly custom RNG
* basic map structure
